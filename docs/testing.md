# Testing
How the UnifiedGoods site can be tested, to ensure that all implimented features work as expected. UnifiedGoods has been tested to be Mobile Responsive. On mobile, the alignment of various elements would be changed in order to accomodate the smaller screen size. In addition, font sizes are decreased as well.

## Preparations
1. Verify that you have created an account with UnifiedGoods.
    - When creating an account, **please DO NOT enter a real password.** Passwords stored in our database are not encrypted, and only sample passwords should be used.
2. Once you have an account, simply log in.

## Navigation Bar
1. Mobile Responsiveness
    - On smaller screens, the *secondary* navbar is collapsed into a Hamburger Menu. By clicking the Hamburger Icon on the top left hand side of the screen, the user would be able to toggle between showing and hidding the mobile navigation tabs
2. Sign in Requirement
    - Some pages require users to sign in before interacting with it, for example, the cart, rewards and profile screen.
    - If the user clicks on the Rewards and Profile Screens and they are not logged in, an alert would prompt them to sign in, then redirect them to the sign in page.

## Home Screen
1. Trending Products
    - For the demostration purposes, the trending products are generated randomly every time the page is refreshed
    - Clicking on a product will bring you to its respective product detail page
2. Categories
    - On every page load, two random categories would be chosen and displayed to the user.
    - The relevant products in these categories would be shown as well.
