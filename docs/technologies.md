# Technologies
When creating this website, we used multiple APIs and libraries in order to add more functionality to our project.
1. [RestDB](https://restdb.io/) -- NoSQL Database for storing user data
2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) -- Chosen CSS Framework
3. [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) -- Open Sourced Icons

To ensure reliability in our products database, we created our own database of products, with data and images taken from the web. This 'database' is essentially a huge JSON file containing about 250 unique products. You can access this JSON file [here](https://assets.ethanchew.com/main.json).
