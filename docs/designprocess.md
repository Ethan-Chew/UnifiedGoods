# Design Process
**UnifiedGoods** was designed to cater to diverse consumer needs. We aimed to develop a website that seamlessly combines modern aesthetics with user-friendly design. Recognising the number of products showcased, we focused on ensuring a good user experience through the implementation of reliable search and filtering functionalities.  
By implementing an interactive game which allows users to earn discounts on the products purchased, this incentivises users to shop for more products and also brings excitment to their online shopping experience.

## Wireframe
The Wireframe for UnifiedGoods was created using Figma. The design shown in the wireframe may not match the final website design due to changes we have made along the way. All screens designed in the wireframe contains both Web and Mobile versions.
